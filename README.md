# FastAPI
This project aims to build a predictive model and associated API for making predictions related to furniture and Breast Cancer.
# Dataset
The dataset used in this project consists of two datasets: the "Breast Cancer Dataset" and the "Furniture Dataset." 
These datasets serve different purposes within the project. The "Breast Cancer Dataset" is used for medical diagnostics and aims to predict whether a breast tumor is benign or malignant. On the other hand, the "Furniture Dataset" is used for predicting furniture-related information.
# Machine Learning Models
The project begins with training a machine learning models, as detailed in the "Furniture prediction notebook.ipynb" and  "BreastCancer notebook.ipynb"
# API Development
We will develop APIs for both predictive models to enable users to make pre![image](https://github.com/soukaina-sta/FastAPI/assets/75736345/d9e95742-342a-429e-af9a-abc894f35520)
