# FastAPI
This project aims to build a predictive model and associated API for making predictions related to furniture and Breast Cancer.
# Dataset
The dataset used in this project consists of two datasets: the "Breast Cancer Dataset" and the "Furniture Dataset." 
These datasets serve different purposes within the project. The "Breast Cancer Dataset" is used for medical diagnostics and aims to predict whether a breast tumor is benign or malignant. On the other hand, the "Furniture Dataset" is used for predicting furniture-related information.
# Machine Learning Models
The project begins with training a machine learning models, as detailed in the "Furniture prediction notebook.ipynb" and  "BreastCancer notebook.ipynb"
# API Development
We will develop APIs for both predictive models to enable users to make predictions based on provided features. These APIs will offer seamless access to the models' predictive capabilities.
